# EloSort 

An android app where you can take a picture or select existing pictures for related items and
be able to rank them easily. By getting two random items in the list of images and choosing the 
better of the two, an approriate elo can be distributed. 
As you continue to pick the better of two random items, 
the list of items becomes 'sorted' to your liking.
